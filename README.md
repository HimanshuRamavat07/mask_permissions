# Mask Permissions

This extension adds a backend module, where you can update your mask permissions for individual BE user groups or just all in one go.
No need to fiddle around in the permissions of backend users anymore!

## How to use it
Just install the extension and go to the new module "Mask Permissions". There will be a list of all backend user groups and an info, if an update is necessary. If so, you can click "grant permissions" and all mask elements will be available for this group.
There is also a button "Grant permissions to all" if all groups should have access.
