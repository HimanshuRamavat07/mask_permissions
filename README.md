# Mask Permissions

This extension adds an update wizard, which updates all of your backend user group permissions for all of your mask elements.
No need to do it manually anymore!

## How to use it
Just install the extension and go to Upgrade->Run Upgrade Wizard. If you have Backend User Groups defined and they need to update mask permissions, the updater will notice and you can run it. This can be done multiple times e.g. if you add more mask elements later on.
